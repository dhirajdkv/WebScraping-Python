# WebScraping-Python

I always wanted to collect info from websites, not by using mouse clicks, but by using few lines of code that can take the websites information into hand.

That's were I got to know about web scraping using python. I started refering to some websites and started to learn how to do web scraping. One of the best website to learn was (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementing-web-scraping-python-beautiful-soup/).

I started to scrape some basic html pages. I took a list of all the universities in INDIA using 20 lines of code in python, Job done.
That was the start to my web scraping in Python.
